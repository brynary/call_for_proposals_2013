# The Enterprise Side of Rails

Despite its anti-enterprise leanings, Rails (and the ecosystem around it) is built upon many patterns from Martin Fowler's Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (PoEAA) published in 2002. A study of how Fowler's patterns have influenced our Ruby ecosystem can help us build better applications and improve our tools.

This talk will explore the "enterprise" patterns baked into Rails (and it's a lot more than just "Active Record"), their implications, as well as alternative patterns that don't make an appearance.

## Talk Rationale (Not for publication)

"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." --George Santayana

DHH was in part influenced by Fowler's book. He even recreated some of Fowler's diagrams to make them nicer (see http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/). Yet most Rails programmers are not familiar with Fowler's patterns, except as their names crept into Rails (e.g. Active Record).

Patterns are born from experience and usually come with tradeoffs and alternatives. A deeper understanding of the relationship between time-tested enterprise patterns and Rails helps avoid needlessly repeating the lessons of the past.
